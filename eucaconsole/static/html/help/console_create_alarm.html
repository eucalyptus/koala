    <div class="body taskbody"><p class="shortdesc"> Auto Scaling uses CloudWatch alarms to trigger scaling actions. An alarm watches a
        single metric (for example: CPU utilization) over a time period you set, and performs one or
        more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold. CloudWatch
        alarms will not invoke actions just because they are in a particular state. For more
        information, please see the Eucalyptus CloudWatch documentation in the <em class="ph i">Eucalyptus User
            Guide.</em></p>

<li class="li step">
                    <span class="ph cmd">Select a statistic from the first drop-down list box. A statistic is
                        computed aggregation of metric data over a specified period of time; valid
                        values are minimum, maximum, average, sum, and sample count. </span>

                        write ops. You can get metric data from Eucalyptus cloud resources (like
                        instances or volumes), or you can publish your own set of custom metric data
                        points to CloudWatch. You then retrieve statistics about those data points
                        as an ordered set of time-series data.</span>

                        a name-value pair that uniquely identifies a metric; for example:

                        Periods define the time period over which the metric value is compared to
                        the trigger threshold, as well as how many consecutive periods the trigger
                        threshold must be breached before the alarm is triggered.</span>
